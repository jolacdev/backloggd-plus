## Business Logic Overview

The content script enhances Backloggd pages. Its current feature exports a signed-in user's game collection from **Settings → Data**:

1. **Authentication and injection** — Reads the username from Backloggd's navigation bar and adds the export action only on `/settings/data/`.
2. **Status selection** — The dialog starts from popup-saved defaults and requires at least one status. Its changes affect only the current export.
3. **Collection pages** — `useProfileGames` parses the first HTML page to determine pagination, then fetches all pages in parallel and deduplicates games.
4. **Game logs** — `useGameDetails` requests `/log/edit/:gameId` sequentially, with a 100 ms delay to reduce rate limiting. Individual failures are skipped.
5. **Downloads** — `useExport` reports `idle → analyzing → exporting → complete` or `error`. On success, the dialog downloads **CSV** (first playthrough per game) and **JSON** (full details), with a short delay between files. Empty results or a failed collection page produce an error instead.

> **Note:** Backloggd's internal endpoints are undocumented and may change. Response types live in [`shared/types/api.ts`](./shared/types/api.ts).

## WXT Content Script Specifics

### Entry Point & Lifecycle

WXT discovers this entrypoint through `backloggd.content/index.tsx`. Its `defineContentScript()` declaration matches Backloggd pages; `main()` mounts the UI only on `/settings/data/` when the user is signed in and the Data Management anchor exists. It skips duplicate mounts.

The script runs in the browser's isolated world: it can inspect the page DOM and use extension APIs, but cannot access Backloggd's page-level JavaScript variables. `index.tsx` mounts `<App />`, which owns the React Query and toast providers.

### Shadow DOM & Style Isolation

The UI is injected via WXT's `createShadowRootUi()` helper, which creates a [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM) boundary.

**Why Shadow DOM?**

- **Style Encapsulation** — Backloggd's CSS cannot leak into the extension UI, and the extension's Tailwind/DaisyUI classes cannot break the host page.
- **DOM Isolation** — The injected component tree lives inside a shadow root (`<backloggd-plus-ui>` custom element), keeping it invisible to Backloggd's own JavaScript and DOM queries.
- **CSS Strategy** — `style.css` is imported as a raw string (`?inline`) and passed into the Shadow Root. DaisyUI is configured with `root: ':host'` to scope its theme variables to the shadow boundary instead of `:root`.

### Turbo-Aware Navigation Monitoring

Backloggd uses [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) navigation, so the script rechecks injection on `turbo:load`. It removes the listener when the extension context becomes invalid.

## Development Standards

### Path Aliases

`@content/*` addresses content modules; `@globalShared/*` addresses code shared across entrypoints. Both are defined in `tsconfig.json`. Use relative imports for nearby files.

### Import Boundaries

Entrypoints must not import each other, and content features must not import other features. Move genuine cross-entrypoint code to `entrypoints/shared/` and content-only shared code to `backloggd.content/shared/`. This is enforced by ESLint.

### Feature Isolation

Keep each feature's components, hooks, API calls, and utilities under its own `features/` directory. Add shared code only when another feature or entrypoint actually needs it.

## API Layer

`lib/axios.ts` configures the Backloggd client:

- **Base URL:** `https://backloggd.com`.
- **Responses:** An interceptor unwraps `response.data`; callers receive the body, not an `AxiosResponse`.
- **Errors:** Another interceptor normalizes failures to `{ message, status, url }`.
- **Types:** [`shared/types/axios.d.ts`](./shared/types/axios.d.ts) makes `api.get<T>()` return `Promise<T>`, matching the unwrapped response.

```ts
const details = await api.get<GameLogDetailsResponse>(`/log/edit/${gameId}`);
```

`details` is the response body. Feature-specific requests and HTML parsing live in `features/export/api/`.
